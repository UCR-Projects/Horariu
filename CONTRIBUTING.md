## üõ°Ô∏è Required Secrets & Environment Variables

To contribute and run the project locally, you‚Äôll need several secrets and environment variables, mostly for the backend:

- **Database credentials:**  
  - `DB_HOST`
  - `DB_USER`
  - `DB_PASSWORD`
  - `DB_NAME`
  - `DB_PORT`
- **JWT Secret:**  
  - `JWT_SECRET`
- **Node environment:**  
  - `NODE_ENV`
- These are typically managed in AWS SSM for deployed environments. For local development, you can use a `.env` file.

## üßπ Code Style

- **Linting:**  
  We use **ESLint** for JavaScript/TypeScript code quality.
- **Tabs:**  
  Use **2 spaces** for indentation.
- **Semicolons:**  
  **Do NOT use semicolons** at the end of your statements or expressions.
- **Formatting:**  
  Please respect the existing code style. Use Prettier if available.

## üß™ Quality & CI

- **Pre-commit hooks:**  
  - Every commit will run the linter (`eslint`) and all tests.
  - If there are lint or test errors, the commit will be rejected and you will **not be able to push** until resolved.

- **Continuous Integration:**  
  - Every push runs a quality workflow (GitHub Actions) to ensure all lints, tests, and checks pass in CI.
  - Your code **must** pass all checks before it can be merged.

## üö¶ Commit & PR Guidelines

- **Conventional Commits:**  
  - All commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification (e.g., `feat: add new login page`, `fix: handle schedule conflicts`).
- **Pull Requests:**  
  - PRs must be **descriptive**. Explain what and why you changed, reference related issues if applicable.
  - Small, focused PRs are easier to review and merge.
  - All code should be reviewed before merging.
